<h2>There is a huge emphasis on “healthy living” in state schools today, much of it focussing on sports and diet. U.K. schools are required to demonstrate that they are including these topics
intheir curriculum, and the topics have been extended to include mental and emotional wellbeing. The great lie behind this is that homosexuality is taught to be an equal “lifestyle choice”
to heterosexuality, and that children exhibiting homosexual tendencies are to be encouraged and supported in the natural choices they make. However, missing from the programmes’ warnings about
drugs, alcohol, tobacco and all the other dangerous activities children may be tempted to explore are the basic facts about homosexuality. “The Journal of the American Medical Association”
revealed that homosexuality may shorten a person’s life by as much as twenty percent. This research has been confirmed many times, including in the “International Journal of Epidemiology”
(Oxford Academy) which stated in December 2001 that “nearly half of gay and bisexual men aged twenty will not reach their sixty-fifth birthday.” The mortality rate due to treatment of 
HIV since 1996 has improved, but again in 2005 we read in “Psychological Reports” that life expectancy for homosexual men is twenty years shorter than for heterosexuals. The main cause of
early death is sexually transmitted diseases, but homosexual lifestyles also result in them being twenty-four times more likely to commit suicide, and over a hundred times more likely to be
murdered. “The Journal of the American Medical Association” found that fifty percent of males who are HIV positive admitted having had sex with an adult before the age of sixteen, and fifteen
percent who were HIV positive revealed that they had had sex with an adult male by the time they were ten. These facts are never revealed to students because it is now unacceptable to suggest
that the homosexual lifestyle is in any way negative, and yet schools promote lies when they ignore the dangers of premature death. Debates about homosexuality in the classroom are never
focussed on disease and death, but on tolerance and human rights, framing the child’s perspective very carefully so that acceptable conclusions are reached. To even suggest the real facts in
a classroom would be enough for a teacher to lose their job: some truths must never be spoken.</h2>
